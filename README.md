# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a telecommunications customer dataset to identify key factors that contribute to customer churn (when customers leave the service). The goal is to understand churn behavior and engineer meaningful features that improve prediction and retention strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset is from Kaggle: [Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis and exploration

## What I Did
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data (handled missing values and data types)
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand customer churn patterns
- Engineered features like average charges per month, tenure groups, and flagged high-risk customers
- Derived business insights to guide retention strategies

## Key Insights
- Month-to-month contract customers are more likely to churn
- New customers with high monthly charges have higher churn risk
- Fiber optic internet customers tend to churn more than DSL users
- Longer-tenured customers show greater loyalty
